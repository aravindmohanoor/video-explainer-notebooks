Python comes with the "standard library," a huge collection of modules that can help you to do your work.

What does the standard library contain? Very few people are familiar with all of it, or even a large proportion of it.

I decided that it's time for me to both learn more about the hidden gems in the standard library, and to help others learn abou tit.

I thus started a series on YouTube, the "Python standard library video explainer," in which I go through the standard library, one little bit at a time.  

I'm doing the video explainer just like my courses at companies around the world, live-coding into the Jupyter notebook.  I'm uploading the notebooks here for public consumption.  Enjoy!
